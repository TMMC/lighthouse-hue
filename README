# Do Better Web

What if we had Clippy for new web platform features? When developers use outdated practices or older APIs, the browser should make recommendations on better options.

I call this tool the **Do Better Web**. Imagine typing in the URL of your page, have the tool analyze your app, then have it spit out suggested improvements to make to the site. Such a tool would be useful for promoting new platform features, help users discover/adopt existing features, and reduce common performance pitfalls.

Example use case: **Do Better Web** finds the app is using `setInterval()` for animations. It would recommend CSS animations or `requestAnimationFrame()` instead with a citation link.
